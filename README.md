# Haxle
Win at Hexle every day!
Haxle is a Chrome extension that gives you the Hexle number every day for that perfect streak! Hexle is created by my friend and colleague [James Livesey](https://github.com/James-Livesey).
## Install
Clone the repository or download a ZIP.
Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode.
Press 'load unpacked' and select the Haxle folder you downloaded.
Today's Hexle will display when you open the extension.
## Install from CRX
Download the latest CRX from the releases tab. Drag it onto chrome://extensions. This seems to work on some platforms, but will not work on others. If it doesn't work, install from source.
## Install from my browser's webstore
Coming soon!
