# Haxle
Win at Hexle and Bytle every day!  
Haxle is a browser extension that gives you the Hexle and Bytle numbers every day for that perfect streak! Hexle and Bytle are created by my friend [James Livesey](https://github.com/James-Livesey).
## Install
- The latest Haxle version is 1.2, as defined in [manifest.json](../main/manifest.json). 
- Clone the repository or download a ZIP.
- Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode.
- Press 'load unpacked' and select the Haxle folder you downloaded.
- Today's Hexle and Bytle numbers will display when you open the extension.
## Install from CRX
Download the latest CRX (v1.2) from the releases tab. Drag it onto <chrome://extensions>. This seems to work on some platforms, but will not work on others. If it doesn't work, install from source.
## Install from my browser's webstore
- Microsoft Edge Addons (currently at v1.0, v1.1 coming soon, then v1.2 once it gets through review) - <https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/haxle/lmldlfkglljkfhklfpadigdaihhfmiko>
- Chrome Web Store - Coming, eventually...
- Firefox Browser Add-ons - Nearly ready!
