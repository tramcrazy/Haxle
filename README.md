# Haxle
Win at Hexle and Bytle every day!
Haxle is a browser extension that gives you the Hexle and Bytle numbers every day for that perfect streak! Hexle and Bytle are created by my friend [James Livesey](https://github.com/James-Livesey).
## Install
Clone the repository or download a ZIP.
Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode.
Press 'load unpacked' and select the Haxle folder you downloaded.
Today's Hexle and Bytle numbers will display when you open the extension.
## Install from CRX
Download the latest CRX from the releases tab. Drag it onto <chrome://extensions>. This seems to work on some platforms, but will not work on others. If it doesn't work, install from source.
## Install from my browser's webstore
Microsoft Edge Addons - <https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/haxle/lmldlfkglljkfhklfpadigdaihhfmiko>
Chrome Web Store - Coming, eventually...
Firefox Browser Add-ons - Nearly ready!
